# Virtual-Health-Monitoring-Dashboard-with-AI-Generated-Reports


It’s a software-only health monitoring system that:
1.	 Simulates health sensor data
•⁠  ⁠Generates realistic readings like heart rate, body temperature, and oxygen saturation on your laptop (no physical hardware required).
•⁠  ⁠Adds noise and filtering to mimic how real electronic sensors behave.
2.⁠ ⁠Displays the data on a live dashboard
•⁠  ⁠Built with Streamlit, showing interactive charts and live updates as if it were an IoT device.
3.⁠ ⁠Generates AI-based health summaries
•⁠  ⁠Uses a generative AI model (OpenAI/HuggingFace) to automatically create personalized reports, e.g.:
“Your heart rate is within normal range and oxygen saturation is optimal. Keep up regular hydration.”
